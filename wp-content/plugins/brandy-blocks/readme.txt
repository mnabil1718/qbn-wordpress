== Description ==

**Brandy Blocks** extends the functionality of the Gutenberg editor by adding new amazing blocks. 

You can use them to add as many predesigned patterns as you like. 

= LIST OF BLOCKS =

1. Testimonials: This block allows you to display a responsive testimonial slider on any page/post using Gutenberg. You can customize the slider to match your website’s design and choose from a variety of animation effects to make it more engaging.

2. Pricing: This block lets you display a three-column pricing table with a highlighted plan. You can customize the columns to match your website’s design. These columns act as a comparison table, and you can add as many rows as you need to display your pricing options, features, perks, etc. 

3. Products with banners

4. Relative posts

And many more!

By default, each **Brandy block** provides individual options and premade styles. You can edit block content within each element. To set up the whole block or parent block options, be sure to look into the **Block Settings** sidebar.

= 2. USING PRICING BLOCK =
